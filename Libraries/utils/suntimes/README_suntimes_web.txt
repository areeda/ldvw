SunTimes web version
====================

This package contains a Java Web application for calculating sunrise
and sunset times. The binary distribution is suntimes.war; installation
should be as simple as installing this WAR in the appropriate place
on your server. For example, with Tomcat, just copy the WAR into 
[tomcat_root]/webapps.

This application has been tested with Tomcat 3.2.1.
