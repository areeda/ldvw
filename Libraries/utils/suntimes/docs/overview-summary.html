<h1>SunTimes class and command-line client</h1>

(c)2000 Kevin Boone/Web-Tomorrow
<p>
This package provides a class <code>SunTimes</code> that can calculate sunrise
and sunset times, and various types of twilight, anywhere on Earth on any date.
It also includes a command-line client and the necessary helper classes.

<h2>SunTimes class</h2>

This is the main class in the package; although it only 
exposes two methods (<code>getSunriseTimeUTC</code> and <code>getSunsetTimeUTC</code>) 
they can be used in a variety of ways.

<h3>Usage</h3>

Here is an example of the use of <code>getSunriseTimeUTC</code> to determine
the time of true sunrise, that is, the time at which the upper extreme of the
disk of the Sun just breaks over the horizon, assuming `average' atmospheric
conditions (see definitions of sunrise, twilight, etc., below). 
<code>getSunsetTimeUTC</code> is used similarly.

<pre>
import com.web_tomorrow.util.suntimes.*;
Time t = getSunriseTimeUTC
  (year, month, day, longitude, lattitude, SunTimes.ZENITH);
System.out.println ("Sunrise is at " + t + " UTC");
</pre>

This displays the UTC sunrise time at the specified location in
hours, minutes and seconds. If a local time is required, the caller
will need to convert the UTC time as appropriate; it is not the
job of this package to do time conversions. 
<p>
Note that to calculate the sunrise or sunset time we need the exact 
date and the latitude and longitude.


<h3>Parameters</h3>

The date is specified as follows.

<ul>
<li> day: 1-31
<li> month: 1-12
<li> year: four-digit year. Note that this value is only used for determining
whether it is a leap year.
</ul>

The location is specified as follows.

<ul>
<li> latitude: degrees north of the equator; south of the equator latitudes are negative
<li> longitude: degrees east of the Greenwich Meridian; western longitudes are negative 
</ul>

The final parameter, zenith, determines the type of result required. If set to <code>SunTimes.ZENITH</code>
it indicates true sunrise/sunset. If set to <code>SunTimes.CIVIL_ZENITH</code>, <code>SunTimes.NAUTICAL_ZENITH</code>,
or <code>SunTimes.ASTRONOMICAL_ZENITH</code> it indicates civil twilight, nautical twilight, or astronomical
twilight respoectively. For an explanation of these terms, see below.

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

The algorithm implemented in this class is based on that described in the US Naval Observatory's
<i>Almanac for Computers</i>, (1990; Nautical Almanac Office, United States Naval
Observatory, Washington, DC 20392), and has been tested extensively against
the tables provided on this organization's Web site 
(<a href=http://aa.usno.navy.mil>aa.usno.navy.mil</a>).
<p>
True sunrise and true sunset conventionally refer to the times when the upper edge of the disk 
of the Sun appears on the horizon at the location of interest. 
Atmospheric conditions are assumed to be average, and the location is level. 
<p>
`Zenith' is the angle that the centre of the Sun makes to a line perpendicular to the Earth's surface. 
If the Sun were a point and the Earth were without an atmosphere, true sunset and sunrise would correspond
to a 90-degree zenith.
Because the Sun is not a point, 
and because the atmosphere refracts light,
this 90-degree zenith does not, in fact, correspond to true sunset or sunrise; instead the centre of the Sun's disk
must lie just below the horizon for the upper edge to be obscured. This means that a zenith of just above
90 degrees must be used. The Sun subtends an angle of 16 minutes of arc, and atmospheric refraction 
accounts for 34 minutes or so, giving a total of 50 arcminutes. So the best overall figure for
zenith is 90+(50/60) degrees for true sunrise/sunset, which is the value assigned to the constant 
<code>SunTimes.ZENITH</code>
<p>
Even when the Sun is slightly below the horizon, a small amout of light is reflected from dust
particles in the atmosphere, and it is not quite dark; this is twilight. The duration of twilight
is more difficult to define than the times of sunrise and sunset, because light fades gradually
as the sun sets. Conventionally we take a zenith of 96 degrees to signify twilight; this
figure is usually called the <i>civil zenith</i>. This period of twilight is the time in which 
it is possible to carry out some forms of outdoor activities, even with no other source of
light. Two other twilight zeniths are recognized: <i>nautical zenith</i> at 102 degrees and
<i>astronomical zenith</i> at 108 degrees. Nautical twilight is the point at which the
horizon stops being visible at sea. Astronical twilight is the point at which the Sun 
really stops being a source of any illumination. 
<p>
Clearly the rise and set times will depend on the date.  In theory there are
also year-to-year variations in sunset/rise times, but they are incredibly
tiny. This <code>SunTimes</code> methods require a year to be specified only to
account for whether it is a leap year or not. For example, March 1st is one day
later on a leap year, compared to non-leap years. In practice this is unlikely
to be affect the result by more than a few seconds. 

<h2>Supporting classes</h2>

<code>SunTimes</code> requires two supporting classes:
<code>com.web_tomorrow.utils.SunTimesException</code> and 
<code>com.web_tomorrow.utils.Time</code>.

<code>SunTimesException</code> is thrown to indicate that the calculation
could not be carried out for some reason. For example, some northerly regions
are in daylight for long stretches of time; an attempt to calculate a sunset time
for such a location at such a time will result in an exception.
<p>
The <code>Time</code> class provides a simple model of time-of-day, which avoids
the system-dependent features of the standard Java <code>Calendar</code> class. All the public
methods in <code>SunTimes</code> return an object of class <code>Time</code>. In
simple cases the application can just call <code>toString()</code> on it to 
get a displayable (24-hour clock) time.


<h2>Command-line client</h2>

<h3>Running the command-line client</h3>

The following command will run the command-line client, if suitably modified
for the file locations on your system.

<pre>
java -classpath $CLASSPATH:suntimes.jar:javapopt.jar com.web_tomorrow.utils.suntimes.SunTimesClient 
  [options] latitude longitude [day] [month] [year]
</pre>

To get a full list of options, use the <code>--help</code> switch. This package
includes a shell script that can be used to run the client and avoid typing the
class and classpath every time, but this will need to be modified to suit the
location in which you install the SunTimes JAR file.
<p>
Any of the day, month and year can be omitted, and current values will be
assumed.  At least one option must be specified, to indicate how to convert
the calculated UTC time to a local time, if at all. The switch
<code>--utc</code> indicates that a UTC time is acceptable and does not need to
be converted.  Alternatively an offset in hours from GMT can be supplied with
the <code>--offset</code> switch, or a timezone with the <code>--zone</code>
switch.
<p>
The results displayed are 24-hour clock times.
<p>
Note that the program does not check that the arguments make sense, beyond
being numbers. So it won't complain if you specify Feb 31st, year -20.  
<p>
Here are some examples.

<ul>

<li> To find sunset and sunrise in London today (latitde 51 degrees N, longitude 0 degrees, approx)
when daylight savings is not in effect (and therefore local time is UTC):

<pre>
suntimes -utc 51 0
</pre> 

<li> To find sunset and sunrise in Wayne, New Jersey, on June 25, 1990 (latitde 40.9 degrees N, longitude 74.3 degrees W)
when local time is 4 hours earlier than UTC:

<pre>
suntimes -offset -4 40.9 -74.3 25 6 1990 
</pre> 

Notice that offset is negative, because it is earlier than UTC, and longitude is negative because it is 
west of Meridian. The results should be -- sunrise 05:26, sunset 20:33. This is important because it
is the test case presented in the NAO algorithm description.

<li>To get a list of recognized time zones:

<pre>
suntimes -showzones
</pre> 

<li>To find the (civil) twilight times in Thule, Greenland (76 deg N, 68 deg W) on April 9th, 2001: 

<pre>
suntimes -zone "America/Thule" 76 -68 9 4 2001 -twilight
</pre> 

Note that its northerly location gives Thule about 21 hours of daylight on this date.

</ul>

Finally, here are a few general notes about the client.

<ul>

<li> If not specified it displays sunrise and sunset. Use the switch `--twilight' to get the
  (civil) twilight times instead. Alternatively use `--zenith' to specify an exact zenith.

<li> Time zone codes are ISO format, e.g., `Europe/London', not the old three-letter codes.
The switch `--showzones' displays a list of supported timezones. If the location required is
not in the list, you can still convert to localtime explicitly using `--offset'. Remember that
negative offsets correspond to places west of the Greenwich Meridian. 

<li> If using a timezone rather than an explicit offset, the program will attempt to correct
for daylight savings time at the specified location. In reality, you may be able to do this
better the the Java system; if in doubt, use an explicit time offset.

<li> The program will tell you if you try to determine a non-existent sunrise or sunset time.
For example, some northerly locations have no sunset for a large part of the year.

</ul>
