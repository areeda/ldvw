<h1>JavaPopt developer's guide</h1>

Kevin Boone, March 2000

<h2>What is JavaPopt?</h2>

JavaPopt is a general-purpose command-line argument processor for Java 
applications. It is intended to make the processing of command-line
arguments a trivial matter in most circumstances. JavaPopt supports most
forms of command line, including single-dash and double-dash switches, numeric (real and integer) arguments,
flags, etc.
<p>
JavaPopt is based on the GNU/Linux popt library for C programs, but with modifications to make it more
suitable for the Java environment. Developers familiar with C popt should find JavaPopt 
straightforward. 


<h2>Legal and disclaimer</h2>

Usual disclaimers apply. Please read the `limitations' section at the end of this document before

<p> 
This software has been made available in the hope that it will be found useful. There is no warranty;
please e-mail comments, bug reports and (even better) bug fixes to <a href=mailto:k.boone@web-tomorrow.com>the author</a>.
Please feel free to use this software in any way you see fit, except to claim it as your own work.

<h2>JavaPopt concepts</h2>

<h3>What is involved in command-line parsing?</h3>

Consider the three following command-line invocations, which between them illustrate
most of the issues that make it difficult to process command-line arguments:

<pre>
java -classpath classes:moreclasses -Xdebug -Dx.y=hello -Dx.c=hello2 myclass
rpm -i --force -nodeps mypackage.rpm
g++ -I include1 -I include2 -fstrict -mcpu=i386 file1.cpp file2.cpp
</pre>

It the first example, the switch `-classpath' is followed by one argument, and this combination should
appear exactly once in the invocation. `-Xdebug', similarly, appears exactly once, but has no arguments.
There can be any number of `-D' switches, but note that the argument follows `-D' directly, there
is no space between the -D and argument. 
<p>
In Popt terminology, `-class' and `-D' are `switch arguments', that is, they are introduced and
specified by switches (-xxx). `-Xdebug' is also a switch argument, but with no arguments. We will refer to this
simply as a `switch' or a `flag'. `myclass' is a `non-switch argument'. It is not introduced by a 
switch, and therefore its interpretation depends on the order in which it appears on the command line.
<p>
In the second example we have three different types of flag: a single-char flag `-i', a long-name flag `--force'
and a long-name flag `-nodeps' specified as if it were a single-char flag. Each of these must appear
exactly once, or not at all. Conventionally some
applications support the grouping of single-char flags, e.g., <code>rm -rf file</code>, which is
equivalent to <code>rm -r -f file</code>. The `rpm' example also requires a single non-switch argument.
<p>
In the third example we have a repeated switch argument `-I', where the argument and the switch can appear any 
number of times. There is a also a long-name switch argument where the argument `-mcpu=i386' where the
argument is separated from the switch by an equal sign, not a space. 

<h3>JavaPopt command-line support</h3>

JavaPopt does not set out to support all these modes of operation, but a fair subset that will be
appropriate for the needs of most programs. Specifically it supports the following types of
command-line usage:

<ul>
<li> Switch arguments in single-character or long-name format, introduced by one or two dashes. The application
may enforce the restriction that long-names are preceded by two dashes rather than one if required

<li> Switches may take no arguments (i.e., be a flag) or one argument. The switch and the argument must be
separated by a space or an equal sign.

<li> Switch arguments may repeat, although this facility is a bit more tricky to use.

<li> Non-switch arguments can be processed internally, or left for the application.

</ul>

In particular, the following are <i>not</i> supported.

<ul>
<li> Switch arguments that follow their switches without a space or equals sign, e.g., -X48.
If there are a small, fixed number of possible arguments, this limitation can be overcome by
entering each one as a separate argument specification. 

<li> Arbitrary switches are not supported. That is, all switches have to be set out in the
switch specification.

<li> There are some restrictions on the use of digits as switches, as will be discussed below.

</ul>

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

The arguments parsed by JavaPopt are located by means of identifiers. This system allows
the application to retrieve the different arguments using the same technique, regardless
of how they were supplied. A switch argument may have a long name, or a short name, or both; a
non-switch argument has neither. However, as they are all supplied with unique identifiers,
when the application executes, for example,

<pre>
String name = popt.getString("name");
</pre>

it does not matter how the name was supplied. This means that the command-line syntax can be
modified without changing the logic of the program.

<h3>Type checking</h3>

JavaPopt can do limited type-checking on arguments. When specifying the details of an argument,
the application indicates its type. Currently <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code> and
<code>Double</code> are supported. <code>String</code> is, of course, the most general, and
can contain any text. <code>Double</code> and <code>Integer</code> attempt to convert the supplied
text into the appropriate class. This may fail, of course, if the command-line does not 
supply appropriate data. There is, as yet, no support for other Java type (<code>Date</code>, for
example), so these should be entered as <code>Strings</code> and converted by the application. 


<h2>Using JavaPopt</h2>

<h3>Basic usage</h3>

For most applications, JavaPopt can do all the argument processing internally. The basic
steps are as follows.

<ul>
<li>Create a new Popt instance, specifying general options if required
<li>Add argument specifications to the list, for both switch arguments and (if required) non-switch arguments.
<li>Call parse() to parse both switch and non-switch arguments
<li>Retrieve the parsed arguments as required
<li>Or, in the event of failure, get the error message
<li>Process any left-over arguments
</ul>

Alternatively, the application can process the non-switch arguments itself,
by calling <code>parseSwitchArguments()</code> to separate the switch and
non-switch arguments, and then retrieving the non-switch arguments by 
calling <code>getLeftoverArgs()</code>.
Or, as another alternative, the application can set a bunch of non-switch
args by calling <code>setLeftoverArgs()</code> and then call <code>parseNonSwitchArgs</code>
to process them.

Here is an example of this mode of operation.

<pre>
  Popt popt = new Popt (args); 
  
  // Tell Popt what arguments we accept. There are two versions of addSwitchSpec(), both
  //  used here. The first version is for flags, which don't take any arguments. The
  //  second is for switch arguments, where the argument name and type are required. Note that
  //  the argument name is only used for usage messages.
  // The arguments for the first versions are: identifier, shortname, 
  //     longname, isCompulsory, description, allowDuplicates
  // For the second version the additional arguments are for the name and type
  popt.addSwitchSpec ("version", 'v', "version", false, "show version", false);
  popt.addSwitchSpec ("double", 'd', "double", false, "a real number", "double", Double.class, true);
  popt.addSwitchSpec ("string", 's', "string", false, "a piece of text", "string", String.class, true);
  popt.addSwitchSpec ("integer", 'i', "integer", false, "an integer", "string", Integer.class, true);
  popt.addSwitchSpec ("longflag", (char)0, "longflag", false, "a flag", true);
   
  // addNonSwitchSpec() specifies arguments that are not introduced by switches. If there are
  //  a variable number of them the application may prefer to handle them itself.
  popt.addNonSwitchSpec ("message", "message", false, "a piece of text", String.class);

  // Add help arguments for --help, -h, and -?
  popt.addHelp (true, true, true);

  // Parse the command line.
  //  parse() returns false if it fails
  if (popt.parse() == false)
    {
    // Parse failed: say why...
    System.err.println (popt.getErrorMessage());
    System.err.println ("Usage: Popt " + popt.getShortUsage());
    // ...and show the usage message 
    System.err.println (popt.getUsage());
    }
  else if (popt.supplied("help"))
    {
    // `help' is a flag, not at argument. It is either supplied or not
    System.out.println ("Usage: Popt " + popt.getShortUsage());
    System.out.println (popt.getUsage());
    }
  else if (popt.supplied("version"))
     {
     // `version' is also a flag
     System.out.println ("JavaPopt version 1.0 (c)2000 Kevin Boone");
     }
  else
    {
    // `double' takes a value (a number). If supplied, get the number.
    if (popt.supplied("double"))
      System.out.println ("double=" + popt.getDouble("double"));
    else
      System.out.println ("double argument not supplied");
    //  ... process other arguments ...
    }

</pre>

<h3>More sophisticated usage</h3>

The problem with the simple example above is that it can't handle duplicate arguments. 
Although the `allowDuplicates' argument is set to `true', indicating that supplying
duplicates is not an error, only the last version can be retrieved using the `getXXX()'
methods. To handle duplicates we need to use a <code>PoptParseHandler</code>. This
interface can be implemented by any class that wants to know when an argument has
been matched. If has one method, <code>handleArg</code> which is called for each
match, specifying the identifier and the argument as an <code>Object</code>. The
application's implementation of <code>PoptParseHandler</code> is responsible for
casting this <code>Object</code> into the real type. 
<p>
A parse handler is set like this:
<code>
popt.setPoptParseHandler(new MyParseHandler());
</code>

setting it to <code>null</code> disables this feature.
<p>
Now, every time the duplicate copies are matched the handler will be called, and
it can take whatever action is required. The handler should return <code>true</code>
if the processing was successful, and <code>false</code> otherwise; in the latter
case parsing will be abandonned. The handler should ideally call <code>setErrorMessage</code>
on the supplied <code>Popt</code> object, because the application will probably go on to
call <code>getErrorMessage()</code> to find why parsing failed.

<h2>Popt notes</h2>

<h3>Autohelp and usage</h3>

JavaPopt can generate short and long usage messages, based on the argument specifications
supplied. See the Javadoc comments for <code>getShortUsage()</code> and <code>getUsage</code>
for more details. 
<p>
In addition, it can add `help' arguments to the argument list, if the application
calls <code>addHelp()</code>. However, JavaPopt can't respond to a `--help' request by 
printing a usage message automatically, as this would not be appropriate in many applications.
So the application will still need to check the `help' argument after parsing.

<h3>Case sensitivity</h3>

Long switch names are always matched without regard to case. This is sensible, as the
purpose of using long switch names is to avoid the need to use switches with different
cases to get a sufficient number of switches. So in this command line

<pre>
--hello --Hello
</pre> 

if they match anything, both arguments will match the same entry.

Short switch names can be made case insensitive, if the <code>ignoreCase</code>
argument to the constructor is <code>true</code>. Popt does not check whether
this it is safe to do this. In general it will be unsafe if you have entries
in the switch table that are distinguished only by the case of their short
names. In other words, if you want this line 

<pre>
-h -H
</pre> 

to be treated as two separate switches you must ensure that <code>ignoreCase</code>
is false.
<p>
Whether you set case sensitivity on or off, it is generally regarded to have command-line
switches that are distinguished only by case. Most people find command-line arguments
awkward enough at best.


<h3>Retrieving results</h3>

After parsing, the application can find the values of the arguments by calling
<code>getArg</code>. This is the most general technique, and returns an
<code>Object</code>, or <code>null</code> if the argument was not supplied.
Convenience functions are supplied to make it easier to retrieve arguments of
known type. <code>getString()</code>, <code>getInt()</code> and <code>getDouble()</code>
return the arguments as a <code>String</code>, an <code>int</code> and a <code>double</code>.
Note that there are no possible <code>int</code> or <code>double</code> values that 
mean `no value supplied', so these methods throw a run-time exception if the value
requested was not supplied by the command line. Therefore it is best to call
<code>Popt.supplied()</code> to ensure that a value exists.

<h3>Default values</h3>

JavaPopt does not have a built-in mechanism for storing default values for arguments
that can be returned if no data was supplied. However, there are a number of convenience
functions that simplify the handling of defaults. For example, <code>getIntOrDefault</code>
takes two arguments: the identifier of the argument, and the default value. If the 
argument was not supplied on the command line, the default is returned instead. 

<h3>Data validation</h3>

Each argument must have a specified type. Currently Popt supports Strings,
integers, and doubles. The equivalent to `don't care' is, of course, String,
as the command-line arguments are Strings to begin with. In other words, there
is no separate type specified for `don't care' (in particular, don't use <code>null</code>).

Popt correctly detects attempts to specify numbers that are out of range. E.g.,
<code>parse()</code> will return <code>false</code> if the user tries to specify
an integer argument `200000000000000', as this is too big for an integer. If you need to
process large-precision numbers, specify them as Strings, and parse them in the application.

<h3>Internationalization</h3>

Popt has no support for internationalization, and it does embed some
English text. This text only appears in error messages, and in the automatically-generated
`help' arguments. All error messages are generated
by specific method calls, so if you want a version of Popt that produces error messages in
a language other than English, you will need to create a sub-class of it, and override the
message generator methods (or hack the source, of course). Here is a list of methods that are
relevant here:
<pre>
protected String getUnmatchedSwitchMessage();
protected String getDuplicateSwitchMessage();
protected String getBadDoubleMessage();
protected String getBadIntegerMessage();
</pre>
Look in the javadoc comments for details of the circumstances under
which these messages will be generated.
<p>
If you want `--help', etc., in a different language, simply forego the use of
<code>addHelp</code> and add your own arguments in the usual way.


<h3>Dashes in arguments, and numeric switches</h3>

This is a tricky semantic issue and, no doubt, the strategy used by JavaPopt
will not suit all applications. Consider the following command line:

<code>
myprog -2
</code>

Is `-2' a switch called `2', or a negative number? If there is no switch 
`-2' listed in the specification, does the user mean minus-2, or is it a typing
mistake (e.g., should have been -w, for example)? JavaPopt assumes that
the minus sign followed by a digit is a number, not a numeric switch, unless
the argument <code>numericSwitches</code> was <code>true</code> in the constructor.
In the latter case, arguments cannot be negative numbers. This strategy is chosen
for its simplicity, and is unambguous, but will not work where a mixture of 
negative numbers and numeric options can appear on the command line.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li> Popt only recognizes `-' as the switch character; this would not be easy to 
change without a lot of hacking.
<li> Popt attempts to format the usage message neatly, but cannot account for the
width of the user's display. The client is responsible for ensuring that switch
names, argument names, and descriptions are of a length such that they don't
overflow a reasonably-sized console window.
<li> Some applications like to use a single-dash argument `-' to indicate 
something, like a default value or the use of standard input. This is not
supported directly by Java Popt. It can be simulated if desired by 
specifying a switch argument whose <code>longName</code> is the empty
String. This will be matched to that string during parsing. 
<li> At present there is no `priority' of arguments; that is, we can't say that
detecting one argument removes the need to parse others. If we declare an argument as
`compulsory' that means what it says: the argument must be
supplied or parsing will not complete. If the application wants
args like `--help' or `--version' to succeed with other arguments incomplete, then
it has to implement the checks for this. Making other arguments compulsory would
defeat the purpose.
<li> The JavaPopt parser has no state; the order of supply of switch arguments is
irrelevant. They are simply saved in a table for later recall. Switch arguments and
non-switch arguments can be intermingled. For example, the following two command
lines are equivalent:
<code>
myprog -verbose file1 file2
myprog file1 -verbose file2
</code>
While this is usually what is required, it won't suit all applications.
</ul>
